# Odin Recipes

## Project Overview
**Odin Recipes** is a simple HTML-based recipe website created as a beginner web development project. The website includes three recipe pages—Lasagna, Biryani, and Kaal Soup—each with a description, ingredients, steps, and an image. The home page provides links to all recipes.  

This project helps practice:
- HTML structure and semantic elements
- Linking between pages
- Using images in a website
- Organizing content with lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`)
