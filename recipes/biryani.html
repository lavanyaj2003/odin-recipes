  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups basmati rice (soaked 30 minutes)</li>
    <li>500 g chicken or mutton, cut into pieces</li>
    <li>1 cup yogurt</li>
    <li>2 large onions, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons biryani masala (or a mix of garam masala, cumin, coriander)</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons cooking oil or ghee</li>
    <li>Whole spices (2 bay leaves, 4 green cardamoms, 4 cloves, 1 cinnamon stick)</li>
    <li>Fresh coriander and mint leaves, chopped</li>
    <li>Saffron strands soaked in warm milk (optional, for aroma & color)</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Water, as required</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Wash and soak basmati rice for 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large pot, heat oil or ghee. Fry sliced onions until golden brown and crispy. Remove half for garnishing.</li>
    <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté until fragrant. Add chicken/mutton pieces and cook until lightly browned.</li>
    <li>Mix in yogurt, tomatoes, biryani masala, turmeric, and chili powder. Cook until the meat is coated and oil separates.</li>
    <li>In a separate pot, boil water with whole spices and salt. Cook the soaked rice until 70% done. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot or handi, layer cooked meat at the bottom, then half of the rice, sprinkle fried onions, coriander, and mint.</li>
    <li>Repeat the layers with remaining rice and garnish with saffron milk and more fried onions.</li>
    <li>Cover tightly (seal with dough if desired) and cook on very low heat (“dum”) for 20–25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Gently fluff the biryani before serving. Garnish with fresh herbs and serve hot with raita or salad.</li>
