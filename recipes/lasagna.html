    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian comfort food made by layering sheets of pasta with rich tomato sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta, and plenty of melted cheese. Traditionally, it also includes a savory meat filling made from ground beef or sausage cooked with onions, garlic, and herbs. Each layer blends together as it bakes, creating a hearty dish that’s warm, cheesy, and full of flavor.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles (cooked al dente)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil<li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>500 g ground beef (or half beef, half Italian sausage)</li>
        <li>2 cups tomato sauce (or canned crushed tomatoes)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning (oregano, basil, thyme)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups ricotta cheese (or cottage cheese substitute)</li>
        <li>1 egg (to mix with ricotta for creaminess)</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil or parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles until al dente, then drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onion and garlic, sauté until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef (or beef + sausage mixture). Cook until browned, breaking it apart with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10–15 minutes to develop flavor.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, and a pinch of salt. Mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom.</li>
        <li>Layer noodles, then ricotta mixture, meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers until the dish is full.</li>
        <li>Top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove foil and bake for another 20 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley, and serve warm.</li>
